        A croissant is a buttery, flaky, Austrian viennoiserie pastry inspired
        by the shape of the Austrian kipferl but using the French yeast-leavened
        laminated dough. Croissants are named for their historical crescent
        shape, the dough is layered with butter, rolled and folded several times
        in succession, then rolled into a thin sheet, in a technique called
        laminating. The process results in a layered, flaky texture, similar to
        a puff pastry.

        Crescent-shaped breads have been made since the Renaissance, and
        crescent-shaped cakes possibly since antiquity. Kipferls have long been
        a staple of Austrian, and French bakeries and pâtisseries. The modern
        croissant was developed in the early 20th century when French bakers
        replaced the brioche dough of the kipferl with a yeast-leavened
        laminated dough. In the late 1970s, the development of factory-made,
        frozen, preformed but unbaked dough made them into a fast food that
        could be freshly baked by unskilled labor. The croissant bakery, notably
        the La Croissanterie chain, was a French response to American-style fast
        food, and as of 2008, 30–40% of the croissants sold in French bakeries
        and patisseries were baked from frozen dough.
